In order to be able to memorize passwords without making them easy to guess, passwords can be created from memorized phrases. We want to create passwords from sentences according to the following rules:
• The password is formed as a sequence of the first characters of each word in the sentence.
• Words in the sentence should all be substrings separated by any number of spaces.
• If punctuation marks are written directly after a word, they belong to the word.
• The password should end with a number that results from the number of capital letters in the sentence
